## Game Title: **Wrath of Rawas**

### Game Overview
**Wrath of Rawas** is a strategic tower defense game where players must protect their main base, gold storage, and magic tower from enemy units. Players build and upgrade various defensive structures while managing resources to fend off waves of enemies with different priorities and abilities.


## 1. Game Mechanics

### 1.1 Core Gameplay Loop
Players will start by placing their special structures (main base, gold storage, and magic tower) in strategic locations on the map. During each wave, enemies will spawn from the evil castle and attempt to either attack the main base, steal gold, or steal magic. Players must build towers and walls to protect these structures and can manually control towers for precision targeting.

### 1.2 Player Objectives
- **Protect the Main Base**: Ensure it does not get destroyed.
- **Safeguard Gold and Magic**: Prevent enemies from stealing too much gold or magic.
- **Resource Management**: Use gold to build and upgrade towers; use magic to enhance tower abilities.

### 1.3 Enemy Objectives
- **Hit the Main Base**: Primary goal if other resources are low.
- **Steal Gold**: Attack and loot the gold storage.
- **Steal Magic**: Attack and drain the magic tower.

### 1.4 Resources
- **Gold**: Used for building towers and walls. Generated by miners.
- **Magic**: Used for upgrading towers. Generated by scholars.

### 1.5 Building Placement
Players can place towers and walls strategically. Each placement recalculates enemy paths. Buildings cannot be placed in locations that completely block enemy paths.
